# Building an Interpretable Network via Transferring Inner Detectors

An inner detector is a unit (filter), representing a semantic concept in the raw
input image, in a intermediate layer. This project is designed to
identify inner detectors, explore their properties and transfer
them. The goal of project is to finally build a high interpretable
network via transferring inner detectors.
